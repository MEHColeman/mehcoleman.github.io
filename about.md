Hello there. I'm Mark Coleman. This is my 'professional' blog.
I'm writing about things I think at least someone might find useful.

I started programming on either a Sinclair ZX-81, a Sharp PC-1500 or an Atari 2600 with the BASIC cartrige, I'm not quite sure which came first.
When I write code these days, its in ruby or elixir.

I'm interested in machine learning, web development and a little bit of dev ops.
